        <h2>Description</h2>
            Garlic Bread makes a fantastic appetizer no matter who you are entertaining as with this recipe it is very quick and easy to make and is packed full of flavour.
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bread</strong>: Ideally you want to use a loaf of either Itallian or French bread for that authentic thick slice garlic bread experience</li>
                <li><strong>Butter</strong>: Salted or unsalted will work fine for this recipe however you will likely want to use a softer butter as the softer the butter, te more likely it will be to melt perfectly.</li>
                <li><strong>Garlic</strong>: Fresh Garlic cloves are ideal for this recipe as when the garlic bread is in the oven the cloves will have the most flavour released compared to other forms of garlic like powder for example</li>
                <li><strong>Herbs and Spices</strong>: For this recipe we will be using a mix of fresh parsley, sea salt and chives for an extra kick of flavour</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1: Prep your pan & bread-</strong>Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or tinfoil, slice your bread in half lengthwise, and place the bread cut side up on the baking sheet.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2: Make the garlic butter- </strong>In a small bowl mix the herbs and salt together with the softened butter. Spread it evenly over the top of the bread halves.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3: Bake & serve-</strong> Bake the bread for 10-15 minutes at 425 degrees F until it’s slightly golden brown on the edges. If you’re adding cheese, add it in the last 2 minutes of baking. Then cool, slice into 1-inch pieces, and devour!</li>
