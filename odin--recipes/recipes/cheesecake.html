        <h2>Description</h2>
        This Cheesecake recipe is as simple as they come for this dish but with fresh fruit and a delicious creamy filling, nobody will ever know.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                 <li><strong>8 3/4 ounces graham cracker or Biscoff crumbs: </strong> Store bought or home made will both be fine for this recipe!</li>
                 <li><strong>2 1/2 ounces unsalted butter, melted: </strong></li>
                 <li><strong>Kosher salt, to taste:</strong></li>
                 <li><strong>16 ounces plain, full-fat cream cheese: </strong>Ideally for this recipe you will use the philadelphia brand</li>
                 <li><strong>5 1/4 ounces sugar:</strong></li>
                 <li><strong>3/4 ounce fresh juice from 1 lemon: </strong></li>
                 <li><strong>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract: </strong></li>
                 <li><strong>1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt: </strong>For table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight</li>
                 <li><strong>12 ounces heavy cream: </strong></li>
                 <li><strong>12 ounces fresh fruit: </strong>Washed and dried</li>
            </ul>
       
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                 <li>Combine cookie crumbs and melted butter in a small bowl</li>
                 <li>Stir in a pinch of salt to taste</li>
                 <li>Sprinkle into a 9-inch tart pan or pie plate,spread into an even layer, then compress firmly with a flat-bottomed drinking glass or measuring cup; this will naturally push the crumbs up the sides of the pan. Keep pressing until the crumbs are in a compact, even layer across the bottom and sides of the pan. Refrigerate until needed.</li>
                 <li>Combine cream cheese, sugar, lemon juice, vanilla, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix at low speed to form a thick paste, then increase to medium speed until soft and smooth.</li>
                 <li>Scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, then switch to the whisk attachment and pour in cream. Mix at low speed to combine, then increase to high and whip until the mixture can hold stiff peaks, 3 to 5 minutes depending on the horsepower of your mixer. </li>
                 <li>Scrape filling into prepared crust and spread into an even layer, using the back of a spoon to sculpt filling into swoops and swirls. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until the filling is firm and cold, about 6 hours or to an internal temperature of 40°F (4°C).</li>
                 <li>To Serve: Top with fresh fruit and cut into wedges with a hot chef’s knife, rinsing the knife under hot running water between slices. Carefully slide a pie server under the crust, making sure it reaches all the way to the tip of the wedge (the first slice will be the most difficult and messy to remove).</li>
        
            </ol>
